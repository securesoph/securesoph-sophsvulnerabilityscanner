# soph's vulnerability scanner üöÄüîç

Welcome to my Vulnerability Scanner project! This Python script is designed to scan a range of ports on a target IP address to identify potential security vulnerabilities based on the banners it retrieves. It‚Äôs a handy tool for assessing the security posture of your systems.

## Features

- **Port Scanning**: Scans a specified range of ports to identify which ones are open.
- **Banner Retrieval**: Retrieves and analyzes service banners from open ports.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Checks for known vulnerabilities based on the retrieved banner information.

## How It Works

1. **Port Scanning**:
   - The script scans ports in the range you specify, detecting which ports are open.

2. **Banner Retrieval**:
   - For each open port, it connects and retrieves the service banner. This helps in identifying the service running on that port.

3. **Vulnerability Detection**:
   - Based on the banner information, the script checks for known vulnerabilities. It provides alerts if it detects specific versions that are associated with common vulnerabilities.

## Code Overview

Here's a quick look at how the code is structured:

- **`loading_animation()`**:
  - Displays a simple loading animation during the scan to keep you engaged.

- **`get_banner(target_ip, port)`**:
  - Connects to the specified port and retrieves the service banner.

- **`check_vulnerabilities(banner)`**:
  - Analyzes the banner to check for known vulnerabilities. It provides information on detected vulnerabilities or potential issues.

- **`port_scan(target_ip, start_port, end_port)`**:
  - Orchestrates the scanning process. It checks ports, retrieves banners, and detects vulnerabilities.

## Example Usage

Replace `target_ip`, `start_port`, and `end_port` with your target IP address and port range, respectively. Here‚Äôs how you can run the scanner:

```python
target_ip = "127.0.0.1"  # Replace with the IP address you want to scan
start_port = 1
end_port = 1024

open_ports = port_scan(target_ip, start_port, end_port)
